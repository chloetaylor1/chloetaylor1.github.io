        This is a robotics activity that we call “Fortune Teller”. it’s pretty simple, the kids draw their own grid with “yes/no/maybe” options and let the ozobot follow the line to answer questions. the truly fascinating part though is the questions they choose to ask. most often they center around gender, politics, and relationships. the most frequently asked question — “Are you a girl?” It’s astounding to see how they ask again if the answer is yes
