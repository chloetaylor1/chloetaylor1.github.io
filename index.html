        <h2>Projects you know and love, remixed for 21st century learning.</h2>
        <p>
            Take It and Make It by Chloe Taylor Tech is project dedicated to "old school" elementary school projects. It invites the reader to take their favorite projects and make them their own.  This site is for parents and educators, it is a remix of traditional elementary school activities with a technological twist. Take It and Make It gives parents and educators an easy entry into STEM education by building on projects they know and love. I was inspired to create this site through my coursework with Project Code from New York Public Library, which introduced new concepts in front- end web development to me in a structured but challenging way.

            I have been a curriculum consultant and educator for over 10 years in New York City. Originally from Pittsburgh, I earned a Bachelorâ€™s degree from Carnegie Mellon University, where I developed an interest in innovative teaching practices and creative technology. As part of the New York City Teaching Fellows program I earned my Master's degree in Education from Fordham University in 2010. I am passionate about creating purposeful learning experiences for students of all ages. A sense of play and wonder are central to my life and work, and I strive to provide unmatched experiences for the students I serve. I am committed to creating curriculum that honors the natural world, and that embraces the limitless magic of technology as well. As an independent education consultant, I work with early childhood, elementary, and middle schools to build comprehensive STEM programs that will instill a passion, appreciation and an empowering confidence in 21st century learning.
